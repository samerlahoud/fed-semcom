You have done an excellent job implementing the paper's ideas while making practical and well-justified design trade-offs. Below is a **very thorough technical critique** of how your final implementation (based on `fed_semcom_v3.py`) aligns with the paper *"An Efficient Federated Learning Framework for Training Semantic Communication Systems"* from IEEE T-VT, October 2024.

## üîß Slightly Divergent but Justified Design Choices

| Paper Element                                   | Your Design                                | Evaluation                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Swin Transformer** for semantic modules       | ‚ùå Replaced with lightweight modules        | Justified: you focus on CPU-friendly TinyML-compatible models                           |
| **Channel model: ZF equalization (Eq. 4)**      | ‚ùå Skipped due to CPU cost                  | ‚úÖ Replaced by efficient diagonal Rayleigh fading and division                           |
| **SNR injection into channel encoder**          | üö´ Not clearly seen                        | Could be added (optional dense layers before `fc`)                                      |
| **DIV2K evaluation and PSNR/MS-SSIM reporting** | ‚ùå No evaluation with real DIV2K or metrics | Recommend adding `skimage.metrics.peak_signal_noise_ratio()` and MS-SSIM for comparison |

---

## ‚ùå Missing Elements (Optional, Based on Goals)

These are not errors, but features you could add for full replication:

1. **Evaluation metrics logging**:

   * PSNR
   * MS-SSIM
   * Reconstructed image visualization

2. **Dataset details**:

   * ImageNet10 for training
   * DIV2K for evaluation

3. **Skip connection in channel encoder**:

   * Paper mentions 7-layer FC network with skip connection (you use only one FC layer)

4. **SNR-aware dense injection layers**:

   * Could replicate the \[21] idea more closely by conditioning on SNR inside the channel encoder

5. **Comparison baselines (FedAvg, MOON, FedProx)**:

   * Only needed if you plan to replicate experimental results fully

| Novel contribution      | üöÄ Your diagonal fading design and modular `apply_rayleigh_channel()` are excellent for TinyML/Federated adaptation |

## ‚úÖ Final Verdict: **Very Good Replication with Practical Optimizations**

You **captured the spirit and architecture** of the original paper, while making necessary adjustments for computational feasibility ‚Äî especially important for CPU-bound systems or deployment on constrained devices. The only major gaps are:

* Omission of PSNR/MS-SSIM reporting
* Skipping full Swin-transformer semantic blocks
* Not evaluating on DIV2K/ImageNet10

If your goal is **prototyping**, you are in excellent shape. If your goal is **publishing a comparative study or re-implementing results**, I would recommend adding:

* PSNR and MS-SSIM logging
* Optional full Swin encoder
* Optional DIV2K test evaluation

Would you like help adding PSNR + MS-SSIM evaluation code or integrating a Swin-style encoder block?
