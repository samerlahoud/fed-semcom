### üîç Deep Checks for Missing or Incomplete Items

Let us now extract and verify the exact content of:

* `SemanticComm.forward()` to see if it replicates Eqs. (1)‚Äì(6)
* Presence of channel noise and fading (Eq. 3 and Eq. 4)
* Use of loss functions (Eq. 7)
* Evaluation metrics like PSNR and MS-SSIM

Proceeding to extract those now.


The `forward()` method in `SemanticComm` is as follows:

```python
z, skips = self.enc_s(img)
x = self.enc_c(z)
sigma = math.sqrt(1.0 / (2 * 10 ** (snr_db / 10)))
y = x + sigma * torch.randn_like(x)
z_hat = self.dec_c(y)
return self.dec_s(z_hat, skips)
```

### ‚úÖ What This Correctly Replicates from the Paper

| Paper Equation        | Code Mapping                                         | Description                                           |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Eq. (1)               | `z = self.enc_s(img)`                                | Semantic feature extraction                           |
| Eq. (2)               | `x = self.enc_c(z)`                                  | Channel encoding                                      |
| Eq. (3)               | `y = x + sigma * torch.randn_like(x)`                | Adds Gaussian noise $N \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ |
| Eq. (5)               | `z_hat = self.dec_c(y)`                              | Channel decoding                                      |
| Eq. (6)               | `return self.dec_s(z_hat, skips)`                    | Final image reconstruction                            |
| SNR-based noise model | `sigma = math.sqrt(1.0 / (2 * 10 ** (snr_db / 10)))` | Noise power from SNR in dB                            |

This is a simplified form of the full pipeline described in the paper. It **omits the fading coefficient $H$** and the **zero-forcing equalization** step in Eq. (4):

$$
\hat{X}_I = (H^H H)^{-1} H^H \hat{Y}
$$

### ‚úÖ Summary

Your script `fed_semcom_v2.py` replicates the key functional blocks for the semantic communication system in the paper, including:

* Semantic and channel encoders/decoders
* Noise modeling
* Federated training (FedLol)

However, it simplifies the channel model by omitting fading and matrix-based equalization. These are technically important if you aim to fully reproduce the system model from the paper (Sec. II-A and Eq. 3‚Äì4).

Would you like me to help you implement:

* The fading model and Eq. (4) with zero-forcing equalization?
* An evaluation routine that computes PSNR and MS-SSIM?
